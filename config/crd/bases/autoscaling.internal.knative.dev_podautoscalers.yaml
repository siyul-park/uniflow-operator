            PodAutoscaler is a Knative abstraction that encapsulates the interface by which Knative
            components instantiate autoscalers.  This definition is an abstraction that may be backed
            by multiple definitions.  For more information, see the Knative Pluggability presentation:

                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.
                        TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.
